# TikTok user info

This script creates a tkinter window with a header label, input label, input field, "Search user" button, and a function that retrieves and displays user information in a cool format, without using PIL. When the "Search user" button is clicked, the script retrieves the TikTok username entered in the input field, makes a request to the TikTok API to retrieve information about that user, extracts the relevant user information from the response, and displays it in a cool table that includes the user's username, avatar, number of videos, number of followers, number of following, and whether the user is private or verified.

**Note:** To use the `rich` library, you'll need to install it first by running `pip install rich.
